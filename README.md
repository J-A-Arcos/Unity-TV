    In the “Video Game Concept Resubmission” document, we mentioned how the game will be a 2D combat game. We had most of the features 
    stated in the document, except for having enemies and jump animation. Enemies were implemented, but due to merging issues the 
    implementation was lost. As for the jump animation, it was not implemented due to time constraints.
